# GameFlow: Running Doom and other games with Airflow

![Plugin Demo](doc/plugin-demo-doom.gif)

Airflow 3.1 can run Doomâ€”and more. This demo showcases the Airflow 3.1 React Plugin System by implementing a plugin
called GameFlow. GameFlow uses React and [js-dos](https://js-dos.com/) to run shareware versions of Doom, Giana Sisters,
and Warcraft II. You can access it from a dedicated page via the Plugins menu or within individual DAG views.
